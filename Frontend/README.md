# Knee Replacement Surgery

## What is Knee Replacement?

Knee replacement, also known as knee arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure to resurface a knee damaged by arthritis. Metal and plastic parts are used to cap the ends of the bones that form the knee joint, along with the kneecap. This surgery may be considered for someone who has severe arthritis or a severe knee injury.

## Why Choose Knee Replacement?

- Severe knee pain or stiffness that limits everyday activities
- Moderate or severe knee pain while resting
- Chronic knee inflammation and swelling that doesn't improve with rest or medications
- Knee deformity
- Failure to substantially improve with other treatments such as anti-inflammatory medications, cortisone injections, lubricating injections, physical therapy, or other surgeries

## Types of Knee Replacement

1. **Total Knee Replacement**: The most common type. The surgeon replaces the surface of the thigh bone and shin bone that connects to the knee.

2. **Partial Knee Replacement**: Only one part of the knee is replaced.

3. **Kneecap Replacement**: The under-surface of the kneecap is replaced.

4. **Complex (Revision) Knee Replacement**: For people who are having a second or third replacement.

## The Procedure

1. **Preparation**: General anesthesia or spinal anesthesia will be administered.
2. **Incision**: The surgeon makes an incision across the front of your knee to access the patella (kneecap).
3. **Realignment**: The patella is moved out of the way, and the surgeon cuts away damaged bone and cartilage from your thighbone, shinbone and kneecap.
4. **Implant Placement**: The surgeon attaches artificial joints to the bones, using special cement.
5. **Closure**: The surgeon closes the incision with stitches or staples.

## Recovery

Recovery from knee replacement surgery typically involves:
- Hospital stay of 1-3 days
- Pain management
- Physical therapy, starting immediately after surgery
- Use of a walker, crutches, or a cane for several weeks
- Gradually resuming normal activities over 6-8 weeks
- Full recovery in 3-6 months

## Risks and Complications

While knee replacement surgery is generally safe, there are potential risks including:
- Infection
- Blood clots
- Continued knee pain
- Implant problems
- Nerve damage

## Long-term Outlook

Most people experience significant pain relief, improved mobility, and a better quality of life after knee replacement. With proper care, a knee replacement can last 15-20 years or more.
